# BuildMod

A simple Minecraft 1.21 building mod using Fabric. It adds two commands:
`/buildcube` which creates a 5x5x5 brick cube around the player, and
`/buildhouse` which consumes 100 oak planks from your inventory to build a
basic wooden house around your position.

## Usage

Install Fabric for Minecraft 1.21 and drop the compiled mod JAR into your mods
folder. In game, run `/buildcube` to generate the structure.
